# Launching and Configuring a DLAMI<a name="launch-config"></a>

If you're here you should already have a good idea of which AMI you want to launch\. If not, choose a DLAMI using the AMI selection guidelines found throughout [Getting Started](gs.md) or use the full listing of AMIs in the Appendix section, [AMI Options](ami-options.md)\. 

You should also know which instance type and region you're going to choose\. If not, browse [Selecting the Instance Type for DLAMI](instance-select.md)\. 

**Note**  
We will use p2\.xlarge as the default instance type in the examples\. Just replace this with whichever instance type you have in mind\.

**Important**  
If you plan to use Elastic Inference, you have [Elastic Inference Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastic-inference/latest/developerguide/setting-up-ei.html) that must be completed prior to launching your DLAMI\.
