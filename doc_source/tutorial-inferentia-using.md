# Using the DLAMI with AWS Neuron<a name="tutorial-inferentia-using"></a>

 A typical workflow with the AWS Neuron SDK is to compile a previously trained machine learning model on a compilation server\. After this, distribute the artifacts to the Inf1 instances for execution\. AWS Deep Learning AMI \(DLAMI\) comes pre\-installed with everything you need to compile and run inference in an Inf1 instance that uses Inferentia\. 

 The following sections describe how to use the DLAMI with Inferentia\.
