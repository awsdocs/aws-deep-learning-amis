## How to Get Started with the DLAMI<a name="getting-started"></a>

Getting started is easy\. Included in this guide are tips on picking the DLAMI that's right for you, selecting an instance type that fits your use case and budget, and [Resources and Support](resources.md) that describe custom setups that may be of interest\.

If you're new to using AWS or using Amazon EC2, start with the [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md)\. If you're familiar with Amazon EC2 and other AWS services like Amazon EMR, Amazon EFS, or Amazon S3, and are interested in integrating those services for projects that need distributed training or inference, then check out [Resources and Support](resources.md) to see if one fits your use case\. 

We recommend that you check out [Choosing Your DLAMI](options.md) to get an idea of which instance type might be best for your application\.
