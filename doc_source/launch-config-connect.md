# Step 2: Connect to the DLAMI<a name="launch-config-connect"></a>

Connect to the DLAMI that you launched from a client \(Windows, MacOS, or Linux\)\. For more information, see [ Connect to Your Linux Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. 

Keep a copy of the SSH login command handy if you want to do the Jupyter setup after logging in\. You will use a variation of it to connect to the Jupyter webpage\.

**Tip**  
If you launch an Amazon Linux instance, the connect dialog box has "root@" in the SSH login command\. This should be replaced with "ec2\-user@"\.
